Write an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for the following decision.

Use the architect agent if available. Gather:
1. What problem or context requires a decision
2. What options were considered
3. What was decided and why
4. What are the trade-offs and consequences

Output a complete ADR in this format:
- Context: problem statement and background
- Decision: what we chose
- Rationale: why this option
- Alternatives considered: table of options with pros/cons
- Consequences: positive, negative, neutral
- Follow-up action items

Number it sequentially (check existing ADRs in /docs/adr/ or /decisions/).
Status should be "proposed" unless told otherwise.
