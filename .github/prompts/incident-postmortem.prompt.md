Gather:
1. Incident title, severity, and duration
2. Timeline of events (ask for details if not provided)
3. Impact: users affected, revenue impact, SLO breach
4. Root cause and contributing factors
5. What went well, what went wrong
6. Action items with owners and due dates

Output a complete postmortem in the standard format:
- Summary (2-3 sentences)
