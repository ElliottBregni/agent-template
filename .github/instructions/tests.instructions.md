When writing or modifying tests:
- Follow the existing test patterns in this project
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Test edge cases and error paths, not just happy paths
- Mock external dependencies, don't make real API calls
- Keep tests focused — one assertion per concept
